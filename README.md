## PyQt4 on WIN 10
Donwload wheel packages  from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4)

In the filenames cp27 means C-python version 2.7, cp35 means python 3.5, etc.

Make sure you grab the correct Windows wheel file (python version, 32/64 bit), and then use pip to install it - e.g:

```
pip install PyQt4-4.11.4-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl
```
